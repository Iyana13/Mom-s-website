  <h1>💐 Happy Birthday, Mommy 💐</h1>
  <p>
    Mom, you’ve been my everything — my strength, my comfort, my biggest supporter, and my best friend.
    You’ve sacrificed so much so that I could have opportunities, a future, and a chance to chase my dreams.
    You’ve carried me through storms with love that never wavered, even when things weren’t easy.
    You’ve done more than raise me — you’ve shaped me into who I am, with your courage, kindness, and faith.
    <br><br>
    I want you to know that I see you, I appreciate you, and I’m so proud of you. Josie, Grandfather, and your dad are watching from heaven,
    smiling, proud of the woman you’ve become — strong, beautiful, and unstoppable.
    You are their legacy, and I am living proof of your love.
    <br><br>
    One day, I promise I’ll make sure you have everything you’ve ever dreamed of — every wish, every joy, every peace you deserve.
    You’ve given me everything I could ever need, and all I want now is to give you the world in return.
    <br><br>
    You’re my heart, my home, and my forever blessing.  
    Happy Birthday, Mommy. I love you endlessly. 💗
